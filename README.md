## Story
The World Cup 2022 is just over with Messi lifting the trophy for Argentina. However, football at home with my 7 years old son Ahmed is going full steam! We have a soft ball and almost every night we turn the living room to Wembley stadium 🏟️. Penalty shout-outs 🥅, one to one matches, sliding tackles with laughing out loud, flying saves, so much going on. As the fun goes on, keeping the accurate score becomes very difficult. We needed a scoreboard. 

Ahmed designed the board and laid down the requirements. Ability to pick your favourite player as your character was a MUST HAVE 😂. This is what he came up with and it inspired us to build this project:

We built this Scoreboard for all parents who love ❤️ in-house football | soccer ⚽️. Enjoy your game 😊!
